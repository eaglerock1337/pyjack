A random attempt at a blackjack simulator game activity ...thing.

## Introduction

I don't really have more to say other than it was a random attempt at a blackjack game. Here's my goals, in no particular order:

* Instead of the usual money simulator, turn it into a game insetad
* Last-person-standing style against the dealer (who, of course, can't lose. At least that part is casino-realistic.)
* Players can have hit points and lose points for a loss (double for blackjack)
* Wins can either restore HP or provide shield tokens, based on settings (gotta jazz it up somehow)
* Variable number of players up to a reasonable limit (e.g. 12)
* All players can be either a human (keyboard input) or AI
* Multiple AI playing types as defined by tables, varying from beginner to ideal gameplay
* Not actively set fire to my computer as I run it

Stretch Goals:

* Some kind of scoring system
* More options to make it more flash
* Maybe make a cash mode if I feel ambitious

## Setup

You just did. There's nothing to set up yet.

## Using the Simulator

#TODO: Get this simulator to work.
